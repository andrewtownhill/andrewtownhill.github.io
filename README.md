## Andrew's Blog site
This is the source repository for my github pages site built using Jekyll and using the minimal default theme

Adding additional pages to the root of the site (like about.markdown and index.markdown ) puts them on the top navigation bar

Add additional posts in the _posts folder to post to the website

Run the following command to execute locally and test before pushing up to github

    jekyll serve 
Server will start, press ctrl-c to terminate

N.B. This page is excluded from site generation by listing under the exclude tag in _config.yml
